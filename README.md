# About Unbounded

Unbounded is possibly the first open source, freely available and on-chain funded font in the world, thanks to the Polkadot treasury.

Unbounded by both name and nature, it is available in six display weights ranging from light to black, as well as a single variable font. The typeface supports both Latin and Cyrillic scripts with over 1300 individual glyphs, including a collection of symbols and a unique figure building system. In addition the sizeable glyph set accommodates for hundreds of languages worldwide.

Unbounded is the product of a joint collaboration between [Studio Koto](https://koto.studio/), [NaN](https://www.nan.xyz/), [Parity Technologies](https://parity.io/) and [Web3 Foundation](https://www.web3.foundation/) for [Polkadot Network](https://polkadot.network).
